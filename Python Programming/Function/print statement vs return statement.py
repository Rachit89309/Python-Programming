# print is a function and return is a keyword
# we can call print and when you want to show something to user you can call print
# return is not going to some value to user, it is not printing
# it will return the value to the caller


# print statement:
# Purpose: Outputs data to the console (or standard output). It is useful when you want to display information to the user or for debugging.

# Effect: Prints the value but does not affect the flow of the program or return a value to the calling function.

# Use case: If you just want to show the result without passing it for further use in the program.


# return statement:
# Purpose: Exits a function and sends a value back to the caller. It is used when you want to pass data from one function to another or store it for later use.

# Effect: Returns a value that can be used elsewhere in the program.

# Use case: If you need the result of a function for later use in the program.


# Key Differences:
# print is just for displaying information.
# return sends a value back to the caller, allowing you to use that value elsewhere in your program.
