''' Linear data structure
contiguous memory location
access elements randomly
homogeneous elements i.e similar elements


Application -
1) storing information - linear fashion
2) suitable for applications that require frequent searching


1-D Array :- 
1D can be related to a row
elements are stored one after another
only one subscript or index is used


Declaration and Initialization - 
array declaration:
datatype varname[size];

can also do declaration and initialization at once:
datatype varname[] = {ele1, ele2, ele3, ele4};










2-D Array
2D can be related to a table or matrix
elements are stored one after another i.e. one 1D array inside another
two subscripts or indices are used, one row and one column
dimensions depends upon the number of subscripts used.'''
